While project development in different fields have different processes, they all have the same core steps.

Developing projects involves a process:
- Movie
- Script and storyboard
- Science experiment
- Scientific method
- Construction
- Blueprint

A system is:
A combination of software (and sometimes hardware) that provides a solution for a problem
Involves: 
- The client (the request and $)
- Analysts
- Designers & developers
- Testers
- Users
- Others (e.g. lawyers, communications officers, specialists etc)

There are many ways to measure the success of a project by answering the following questions:
- Does the project solve what it was meant to solve?
- Is it easy to maintain and administer?
- Is it scalable to meet the needs of the client?
- Is there a successful support system in place for the client?
- Was it delivered on time and ready to go?
- Was the client happy with the finished product?

The software development process:
- A mistake made in one phase often requires the developer to backup and redo some of the work in the previous phase
- To minimize the amount of mistake, a software development process must be employed
- Creating high-quality software involves organization, planning and utilizing various diagrammatic conventions 
- Computer scientists have created a view of the software development process known as the "software development life cycle"(SDLC) 
- One method is known as the "waterfall model"

The waterfall model: 
- Developed by Dr Winston Royce in 1970 based on his experience developing software for spacecraft mission planning
- The Waterfall Model consists of several phases: 
   - Problem Statement
   - Analysis 
   - Design 
   - Implementation 
   - Integration /Test
   - Maintenance 

The software development process:
- The waterfall model of the software development life cycle
- Mistakes found early in the SDLC are much less expensive to correct than those found later
- The cost of developing software is not spread equally over the phases

Some of the following tools could be useful project management tools:
- Gantt Chart
- UML
- Daily Log
- Weekly Reports
 -Communication
- Microsoft Teams
- Slack
- Google Spaces

Gantt Chart:
- Developed by mechanical engineer Henry Gantt in the 1910's
- Tool typically used by people working on a large project like
   - Hoover Dam
   - Eisenhower National Defense 
   - Interstate Highway System
- Helps project managers to visualize, schedule, and track scheduled as well as actual progress of projects

UML:
- Unified Modeling Language
- Visually specifies parts of a system
- Complex software designs are much more easily described through UML than textually
- UML can be complicated to learn, you are not required to use it for your projects
